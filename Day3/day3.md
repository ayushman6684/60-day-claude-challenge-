# Day 3 — Role-Based Prompting
**ABTalks 60-Day Claude AI Mastery Challenge**

---

## What is Role-Based Prompting?
Role-Based Prompting means telling Claude WHO to be before asking a question.
Instead of asking directly, you first assign a professional identity (role) to Claude.

**Formula:**
> "Act as a [ROLE]. You are an expert in [DOMAIN]. Help me with [TASK]."

---

## Why It Matters?
Without a role, Claude gives generic answers.
With a role, Claude thinks like a domain expert and gives specific, actionable answers.

## Experiment — Same Question, 3 Different Ways

**Question Asked:**
> "How should I price my new productivity software?"

---

### 1. Without Any Role
**Prompt:** "How should I price my new productivity software?"

**Output:**
Pricing depends on your costs, target market, and competitors.
Research similar tools and consider your value proposition.

**Observation:** Generic, surface-level, not very useful.

---

### 2. With Founder Persona
**Prompt:** "Act as an experienced SaaS Founder. How should I price my productivity software?"

**Output:**
Use value-based pricing. Launch with 3 tiers: $29/$99/$299/month.
Offer 20% annual discount to reduce churn.
Start with 14-day free trial, no credit card required.

**Observation:** Specific numbers, strategic thinking, founder mindset.

---

### 3. With Developer Persona
**Prompt:** "Act as a Senior Developer who has built SaaS products. How should I implement pricing?"

**Output:**
Use Stripe with feature flags per tier.
Implement usage metering for consumption-based pricing.
Make sure DB schema supports plan upgrades without data loss.
Start with 2 tiers max — complexity kills MVPs.

**Observation:** Technical focus, architecture-first thinking.
